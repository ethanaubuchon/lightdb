# LightDM

Light or (Light Data Manager) is a light weight key value store that can be run as a stand-alone daemon or a package integrated into another go application.  It is designed, primarily, to handle maintaining data in a semi-persistent state during application runtime without requiring a separate application such as Redis or Memcached.
